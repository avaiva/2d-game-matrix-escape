## <span style="color: #7FEAA1;"> The idea </span>

"Matrix Escape: Debugging Reloaded" is a captivating game designed for coders and coding enthusiasts. It presents a unique experience that resonates with those entrenched in the coding realm. Players are immersed in the challenge of debugging console errors by identifying and locating bugs hidden within the Matrix of Code. The game's timer is set for a swift 3-minute round, offering a sense of urgency as players race to debug as many bugs as possible. Following the game, players receive a score, reflective of their debugging prowess.

**Target Audience**
- Coders and coding enthusiasts

**Coding Analogy**
- Playfully parallels a coder's life: 10% writing code, 90% debugging

**Mindset Transformation**

## <span style="color: #7FEAA1;"> The MVP </span>
In the initial version of 'Matrix Escape: Debugging Reloaded,' we focus on three primary objectives that form the core of the game's functionality:
1) Developing the mechanics for randomly spawning and moving bugs, which will be a fundamental aspect of the game.
2) Creating the logic for catching bugs and calculating the player's score based on their performance.
3) Exploring and experimenting with the game's storytelling, branding, and overall design to gain a better understanding of its potential.

- imiting the console's error capacity to 8/6/4.

**Version 3 - Level 5**
- Raising the difficulty by introducing a product owner who needs timely feature deliveries
- Delivering a feature for every third bug fixed, improving the product owner's mood
